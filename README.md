# Deep Optimal Stopping Project

This project was completed for the course *STA 4246: Research Topics in Mathematical Finance* during my master's degree at the University of Toronto. The requirements of the project were to choose a recent paper in an academic journal related to mathematical finance and expand upon it in some way. I chose the paper *Deep Optimal Stopping* by Sebastian Becker (2018), which employs a feed-forward, multi-layer neural network to solve optimal stopping problems. Specifically, I implemented the algorithm described in Becker's paper in Python in order to find the price of a Bermudan max-call option. The Python code can be found in the file *DOS.py*. In addition, I conducted a literature review in which I discuss related machine learning techniques that have been applied to optimal stopping problems, such as Q-Learning and convolutional neural network approaches. The file *DOS - Report.pdf* contains a detailed report of the project and *DOS - Presentation.pdf* includes the slides I made for the project presentation.
